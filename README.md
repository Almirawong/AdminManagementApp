# Jewellery Admin Management System

This is an admin management system app prototype where users would be able to add jewellery (name, type, price, company, material, and quantity) and search, edit or delete jewellery records that exist in the database. 

## Dependencies


To run an SBT (Scala Build Tool) project, you typically need to install SBT itself and have the necessary project dependencies specified in your **build.sbt** file. 

Install SBT:

On Linux/macOS, you can use a package manager like **`brew`** or **`apt`** to install SBT.
On Windows, you can download the SBT MSI installer from the [official website](https://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html).
After installing SBT, you can check the installation by running **`sbt`** in your terminal. If SBT is correctly installed, it will start the SBT shell.


## How to Run the App
1. In the project directory, you can run:
```
sbt
```
You should be able to see results like this:
![sbtResult](/src/main/resources/images/sbtResult.png)

2. If there are no errors, proceed to execute command:
```
run
```
You should be able to see results like this:
![runResult](/src/main/resources/images/runResult.png)
